            "entry": "There are a number of elements to the prevailing work ethic that disturb me.  There seems to be a significant amount of self-destructive behavior that is, strangely, a grass-roots movement.  What I've seen is that programmers are faced with a paradoxical problem.  Where in the past innovation has generally occurred in fits and starts, over a period of decades, innovation in this generation has become a commodity.  There was a time within the memory of people alive when 'big' news was an occasional event.  Now our desire for novelty is an all-consuming hunger.  \r\n\r\nTo fuel that hunger, we live in an age of start-ups and entrepreneurial ventures that burn developers like so much tinder.  In many places I've worked, the employees are fairly well paid, but the prevailing attitude comes straight out of a Steinbeck novel.  There's an attitude of putting in more hours, working yourself to the bone, and struggling with frustrating problems with no time to enjoy the fruits of your labors.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I love hard work.  Those who have worked with me know that when I focus on a task, I work with an intensity that is both fierce and productive.  I don't fear complex or time-consuming tasks.  If I have to rip apart hundreds of files and grep all over creation to get the code working, I will.  My concern is not over people working hard.\r\n\r\nMy concern is the short-sightedness of destroying one's mind and body for the short-term gain of an enterprise.  I believe in focused, intense work.  I enjoy high productivity.  What does concern me is the continuous long-hours, caffeine-driven 'powering-through', and eye-rolling hacked-together work that is becoming the standard of my industry.\r\n\r\nIn the Google Talk I watched on scrum (http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7230144396191025011 ) one of the most disturbing points to me was that programmers have learned to lie without remorse.  It's accepted that hacked together code should reach production.  Coder's speak of their un-maintainable tricks and hacks with pride, as if they've won an award by making a piece of functionality work in a way that will cost hours or days of future maintenance.\r\n\r\nSo this rant is all well and good, but what's my solution?  Honestly it's to work harder, and work less.  I've found, in my own experiments, that I can work as little as 6 hours a day and be as productive as an over-stressed, strung-out-on-coffee coder working 10 hours.  I spend a lot less time sitting and staring at the screen.  I make fewer mistakes.  The code I write is easily decipherable several weeks later.  I don't think I'm smarter, or better than my peers.  If anything, they have a greater knowledge and experience.  I just believe that time has both volume and density, and their robbing their employers of value by destroying themselves with exhaustion.\r\n\r\nWhen I rule the world, or at least my own company, I figure about a 18 hour max work week should be about right.  4 days of 2 hour bursts of productivity.  15 minute meetings at the beginning and end of each day.",

I remember thinking, won't that be interesting, when we have enough automation to supply the world's need for labor, and we can get by with much more efficient workdays.  I wondered if we'd become more philosophical, or perhaps more exploratory.  Much of Star Trek is based on the assumption that once you can deal with world hunger, that society will improve and become more socially just.\r\n\r\nIt works out, that's not the way of human nature.  What ends up happening is that the people with power to make decision generally make them out of self-interest.  That's all well and good, but for some reason innovators keep going on their merry way...innovating.  The funny thing to me is that there's not really a bad guy here.  There are just short-sighted people punishing themselves.\r\n\r\nI talk with a lot of friends and co-workers who are pushing themselves into the ever-expanding funnel of burnout (which I'll explore in a different comic).\r\n\r\nI'm open to the idea that I'm wrong about this, but I find that it's important for me to know what my \"win condition\" is, so that I recognize it when I get there.  In this economy, there's much talk of constant growth.  I'm not sure I like the idea of an economy based on constant growth.  It feels to me like someone thinking they can run across a river on a wire if they can just get going fast enough.  I think I'd rather learn to balance and take my time.  Maybe look around a little.\r\n\r\nI'm not in a hurry to retire.  I want to learn to enjoy where I am right now, and not burn myself out.  So, while I will constantly look for ways to make things more efficient, I generally use the gained time to do something right where I would otherwise be rushed.  Everyone gains from that, even if they don't necessarily know why.\r\n\r\n-Peter\r\n",

I usually try to benefit them in some way.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there's a tiny nagging voice in the back of my head that really enjoys seeing the whipcrack of a well delivered insult.  Laura's solution was her way.  My way (and Jenn's) was to try to find people who honestly weren't sensitive about something, and then just really unload.  It's very therapeutic.\r\n\r\nFortunately, despite her constant eating, her metabolism has, so far, stayed ahead of the curve.  I hate to think what would happen if she actually got fat.  The sudden absence of teasing would become deafening.\r\n\r\nOf course, in our often spectacular trade offs, I usually win...cause she has trouble delivering insults between Twinkies (tm). :p\r\n\r\n- Peter",
