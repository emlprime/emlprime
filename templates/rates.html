  <p>Our rates can be broken down into three categories: start-up costs, maintenance costs, and coding costs. </p>

  <p>We provide all the services necessary for you to launch a new web project.  We offer domain registration, and e-commerce establishment in addition to our programming services.  Domain registration is a flat $50 fee, and the e-commerce link to an existing merchant account is $300.</p>

  <p>We also provide full hosting and maintenance services.  Hosting, e-commerce maintenace, https certification, and periodic backups are among the many services we provide for your website.  A full monthly or quarterly cost estimate for your site is available upon request.</p>

  <p>Our programming services are available at the cost of $100 per task point.  We assign point values to each task in your project backlog and charge per point - thus ensuring that the project will be completed at the quoted price.</p>

  <p>Here's an example of what an invoice might look like:</p>

  <ul id="invoice">
    <li>Domain Registration: $50</li>
    <li>E-Commerce Set-Up: $300</li>
    <li>10 points @$100/point: $1000</li>
    <li>Total: $1350</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We ask for a 25% deposit before we begin work on a sprint.  The remaining 75% of payment is due when the project has been completed and meets all your expectations.</p>
